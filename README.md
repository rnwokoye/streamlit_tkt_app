## Traffic Ticketing App

### Overview

The Traffic Ticketing App is a comprehensive solution designed for law enforcement agencies to streamline the process of issuing traffic tickets.
Built using Streamlit, this app allows traffic officers to enter offense details, capture photographic evidence using a camera (planned), and store all information efficiently in a CockroachDB database. Tickets older grace period of 30 days after which the fine amount is doubled. Ticket overview in the admin page allows for filtering all tickets by status, offender, issuer, license plate etc.
The app's intuitive interface and seamless integration of image capture and database storage make it an essential tool for modern traffic management particularly in emerging nations where traffic obedience is a sever challenge,
and enforcement methods proved ineffective.
